SOC Learning and Lab Work – Documented core SOC concepts and hands-on activities for alert handling and incident response. Theoretical topics included alert prioritization (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on impact, asset criticality, exploit likelihood, and business risk using CVSS; incident classification (malware, phishing, insider threats, data exfiltration) mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and VERIS frameworks; and incident response lifecycle following NIST SP 800-61, covering preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned with emphasis on isolation, evidence preservation, and communication.

Practical implementation involved creating alert classification tables, CVSS-based prioritization, and visualizing alerts using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Incidents were tracked and managed using Kibana’s Cases feature, triaged with VirusTotal and AlienVault OTX, and supported by evidence preservation using Velociraptor and FTK Imager. A capstone exercise simulated an attack with Metasploit, followed by detection, triage, response, and full reporting within the ELK environment.
